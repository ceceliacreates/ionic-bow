### MVP functionality

- A user can view potential matches and choose to "Pass" or "Like"
- If a user passes, a new potential match appears and the passed match does not appear again
- If a user likes a match, they are prompted to choose three traits they like most about the match
- A user can view a list of matches
- A user can view the profile for an individual match
- A user can see which traits they selected for an individual match
- A user can view their own profile
- A user can edit their own profile

#### Notes

- The MVP is client-side only
- The MVP is single user only
- The MVP assumes all potential matches have already liked you (you charmer! 😉)
- The MVP uses generated data and placeholder images/text
